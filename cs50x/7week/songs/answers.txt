If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018,I would characterize their audio aura as purple. Because there are a goodnumber of rap songs in the playlist. And while serveying I found that 100 songs are fron 70 different artists. We have 6 songs from XXXTENTACION(RIP) and Post Malone and we also have 4 songs from Drake. And if we consider this as one's playlist he had listened to almost every masterpiece that have been created that year. Thats whay I would characterize their audio aura as purple.

I have calculated this aura by the vibe of the popular artists which is not a scientific way of doing this. Although I could calculate their audio aura by calculating the average of danceability, energy wheather they like songs of higher tempo etc. That would be a better way to calculate audio aura
